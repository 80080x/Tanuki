# Tanuki 40% keyboard
### Case files

These are the case files for the Tanuki. There is a choice between 3d printing and lasercutting a sandwich case. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Notably for 3d printing is the time printing the parts and the work needed to make it pretty afterwards. For lasercutting its the amount of paintwork that needs to be done and the relative annoying way of assembly.

### 3D Printing
The 3d printing files are split up into 5 files. Don't freak out most of them can be ignored based on your preferences and 3d printer. The full keyboard case doesn't fit on my Anet A6 and when I look around at the bed sizes for most 3d printers it likely won't fit on yours either. This is why the keyboard is split into 2 pieces.

*In case you have a big 3d printer*
+ TanukiCase.stl
+ TanukiCase_nologo.stl

*In case you have a 3d printer with a "average" size printbed*
+ TanukiCase_left.stl
+ TanukiCase_right.stl
+ TanukiCase_right_nologo.stl

The ..._nologo files are there because they have no indented logo on their front face. With 3d printed parts more porous than smooth acrylic it is near impossible to scrape the paint off the front. I ended up filling it in with a very thin needle and the end result is well... ok enough? I decided to include files without the logo so you have a choice.

*Print settings*
These vary from printer to printer, don't expect the first attempt to come out perfect.

+ layer height: 0.2mm
+ wall thickness: 1.2mm
+ infill density: 30%
+ infill pattern: lines
+ no support needed

You may need to rotate the model so the front of the case is laying down on the bed of the printer.

*Print aftercare*
Make sure to sand the inside of the mating surfaces of your print before attempting to glue it together. Glueing the parts together works really well with some low viscosity CA glue.

*What about the bottom of the case?*
Currently I just mount a lasercut 3mm clear acrylic part on the bottom with some 3mm bolts. However in the future I might design some nice 3d printed part that lets the light through nicely.

### Lasercutting
The Tanuki is designed to be laser cut out of 3mm acrylic but you are welcome to experiment. Please keep in mind the height needed for the components.
+ BLACK is a raster engraving.
+ BLUE should be the first lines to get cut.
+ CYAN should be the second lines to get cut.

If your local lasercut shop uses the colours differently please adjust them according to their specifications.

The strange circles and rectangles are there to be used as standoffs or as a way to hold the micro controller in place in case you're doing a handwired build.
