# Tanuki 40% keyboard
### Case files

These are the case files for the Tanuki.
The Tanuki is designed to be laser cut out of 3mm acrylic but you are welcome to experiment. Please keep in mind the height needed for the components.
+ BLACK is a raster engraving.
+ BLUE should be the first lines to get cut.
+ CYAN should be the second lines to get cut.

If your local lasercut shop uses the colours differently please adjust them according to their specifications.

The strange circles and rectangles are there to be used as standoffs or as a way to hold the micro controller in place in case you're doing a handwired build.
