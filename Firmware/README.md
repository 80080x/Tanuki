# Tanuki 40% keyboard
### Firmware files

This firmware release is for the PCB version only.

40% keyboard designed by Seth-Senpai. This repo is meant for the pcb version of the Tanuki. If you made any modifications to the board please make sure that the firmware reflects these changes.

The pcb version uses a Pro Micro (atmel 32u4 based) controller.

##### Why are these files here?
The firmware files are also hosted over at [QMK](hahahlinksoon) and should be used to compile the firmware in a way that you like. These files are posted here to consolidate the files in one place and allow people to compile using older versions of QMK.

##### What do I do with this?
If this is your first time compiling keyboard firmware you might want to check out the [QMK guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/) or if you made no changes just [flash the .hex file to your pro micro](https://docs.qmk.fm/flashing-firmware).
